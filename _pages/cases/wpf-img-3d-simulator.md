### Inkjet Printing Equipment Quality Prediction Method

Extended an existing NVMe host driver to support Multi Physical Functions (MPF) as well as Single Physical Function (SPF). By redesigning the static array-based global variable model of the legacy driver into a reference-counting-based list structure, I reduced the module size and increased scalability.

**Highlights:** Kernel 5.9.16, Significantly Reduced Module Size, Increased Maximum Supported PF Count

**Tech:** Linux Kernel, PCIe, NVMe, Debug
