title: Empathetic Technical Decision-Making
---

I balance technical logic with emotional intelligence. I approach code reviews and architectural decisions with empathy, especially when dealing with legacy systems.

**Examples:**

- Proposed an incremental refactoring plan rather than a total overhaul, respecting existing workflows and reducing friction for collaborators.
- In reviews, I prioritize understanding over fault-finding, asking "Did I interpret your intent correctly?"

**Key:** Legacy-Aware Design, Collaborative Reviews, Empathetic Judgment
