I believe what's not documented doesn't scale. I design workflows, logs, and debug systems that are traceable, reusable, and self-explanatory.

**Example:** Created custom debug log formats and issue-tracking templates for the team, ensuring consistent knowledge sharing and future-proof traceability.

**Key:** Self-Documenting Systems, Repeatable Processes, Traceability
