title: Bridge Between Domains
---

I act as a translator between domains—engineering and design, logic and emotion. I value clarity of expression as much as correctness of implementation.

**Example:** While developing an image-processing simulation for OLED printing (SSINK), I created a GUI overlay that translated algorithmic thresholds into intuitive visual indicators for non-engineering stakeholders.

**Key:** Cross-functional Communication, Technical Translation, Human-System Interface
